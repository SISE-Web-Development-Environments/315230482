        <h1>Q&A</h1>
        <h2 class="questions">Q1) Three main diffrences between web1,web2 and web3:</h2>
        <ol class="answers">
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 1.0</u>:</b><br />
                Web 1.0 was the first reiteration. Actually it was called ‘The Internet’ not version 1 or Web1.0, while experts called it the Read -Only era.
                The main features of ‘The Internet’ were hyper-linking and bookmarking of the web pages.<br />
                The best examples of ‘The Internet’ are static websites which were made during the ‘.com evolution’.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 2.0</u>:</b><br />
                The information available through Web 2.0 empowered the new generation to develop new concepts like Wiki, Widgets and Video streaming.
                It also allowed many users to publish their own content through few basic steps, which was not possible in the Web 1.0 or The Internet.
                Web 2.0 was responsible for the development of various sites that we commonly use today like Twitter, Flickr and Facebook.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 3.0</u>:</b><br />
                Web 3.0 is known as the third generation of World Wide Web. It has everything that we could ever wish for! <br />
                With the help of Web 3.0, web content was easily carried in the form of natural language, with natural language search, recommendation agents which are commonly known as AI- Artificial Intelligence. <br/ >
                Through such advancements in Web 3.0, we have become empowered to do many things that we may have never dreamed of.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <b>But this not the end, as with the time we will get to see more advancements in World Wide Web that will make internet surfing an amazing experience.</b>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h2 class="questions">Q2) Medicines side effects Use Case:</h2>
        <ol class="answers">
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 1.0</u>:</b><br />
                The user will have to remember the url to the website that 
                talks about Medicines side effects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 2.0</u>:</b><br />
                The user can now serch "Medicines side effects" in a serch engine, and get links to sites that have tags including parts of the query.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u>Web 3.0</u>:</b><br />
                Just like in Web 2.0, the user can serch for "Medicines side effects" in a serch engine.
                But only this time the results of the serh won't be based on tags- the results will be sites that have strong semantic connection in thier text to the keywords and their combination.
